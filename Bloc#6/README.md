### Data:
Training data for the Deepfake deeplearning model consists of:
- 401 sample videos (77 real and 323 deepfakes) from the [Kaggle Deepfake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deepfake-detection-challenge/data?select=train_sample_videos) 
- 890 Real celebrity and youtube videos from [Celeb-DF-v2](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics) 
- 795 Deepfake celebrity videos from [Celeb-DF-v1](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics)  

**The final database, after preprocessing, contains 1091 Deepfake videos and 954 real videos.**

Both the Celeb-DF-v1 and Celeb-DF-v2 datasets are available upon request by completing a form.Credits for the Celeb-DF datasets go to: *Yuezun Li, Xin Yang, Pu Sun, Honggang Qi and Siwei Lyu, Celeb-DF: A Large-scale Challenging Dataset for DeepFake Forensics, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Patten Recognition (CVPR), 2020*
